Calculates the MÃ¸ller cross-section (cs) for large-angle
electron-electron collisions between an incoming electron with initial
:math:`gamma=g1` (relatistic gamma function) and an electron at rest, which
acquires :math:`gamma = g` in the collision. 
Input g and g1 can be arrays (of the same size).

Calculates the integral

.. math::

    \int_{\gamma_m}^{\gamma+1-\gamma_m} \Sigma(\gamma,\gamma_1) d\gamma_1

analytically. 
This calculation is needed for the full, conservative close-collision operator.
Gamma can be a vector or array, :math:`\gamma_m` must be a scalar. 
If :math:`\gamma+1-\gamma_m< \gamma_m`, the integral is set to be zero.

Interpolates each legandre mode function from distribution for itself with the momentumGrid in query.
The distribution in Distribution is interpreted to be zero above its maximum momentum, and in legandre modes higher than its Nxi.
Input:

    dist - :class:`Distribution` object, from which the distribution should be interpolated.
    
    MG - :class:`MomentumGrid` object, to which grid the output distribution is interpolated.

outPls = LegendrePolynomials(l,x)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: outPls = LegendrePolynomials(l,x)

LegendrePolynomials calculates :math:`P_l(x)`.

Calculates the legendre polynomials :math:`P_i(x)` for :math:`i=0,1,...,l` using
Bonnet's recursion formula:

.. math::

    (n+1)*P_{n+1}(x) = (2n+1)*x*P_n(x) - n*P_{n-1}(x),

where :math:`P_0(x) = 1` and :math:`P_1(x) = x`.

Usage:
pls = LegendrePolynomials(l,x)

l is the (highest) mode number and x is the coordinate, which must be
a row vector (not a matrix). 

pls has the structure

.. math::

    \begin{matrix}
    [ P_0(x) ]\\
    [ P_1(x) ]\\
    [   ...  ]\\
    [ P_l(x) ]
    \end{matrix}


[x,w] = lgwt(N,a,b)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: [x,w] = lgwt(N,a,b)

This script is for computing definite integrals using Legendre-Gauss
Quadrature. Computes the Legendre-Gauss nodes and weights on an interval
[a,b] with truncation order N

Suppose you have a continuous function f(x) which is defined on [a,b]
which you can evaluate at any x in [a,b]. Simply evaluate it at all of
the values contained in the x vector to obtain a vector f. Then compute
the definite integral using sum(f.*w).

[x, w, D, DD] = m20121125_04_DifferentiationMatricesForUniformGrid(N, xMin, xMax, scheme)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: [x, w, D, DD] = m20121125_04_DifferentiationMatricesForUniformGrid(N, xMin, xMax, scheme)

Finite difference differentiation matrices and integration weights for a
uniform grid.

Created by Matt Landreman,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Plasma Science & Fusion Center, 2012.

Inputs:

    N - number of grid points.

    xMin - minimum value in the domain.

    xMax - maximum value in the domain.

    scheme - switch for controlling order of accuracy for differentiation and handling of endpoints.

Options for scheme:

    0 -  The domain [xMin, xMax] is assumed to be periodic. A 3-point stencil
    is used everywhere. A grid point will be placed at xMin but not
    xMax.

    1 -  Same as scheme=0, except a grid point will be placed at xMax but not
    xMin.

    2 -  The domain [xMin, xMax] is assumed to be non-periodic. A 3-point
    stencil is used everywhere.  The first and last row of the
    differentiation matrices will use one-sided differences, so they
    will each have a non-tridiagonal element.

    3 -  The same as scheme=2, except that the first differentiation matrix
    will use a 2-point 1-sided stencil for the first and last elements
    so the matrix is strictly tri-diagonal.  The 2nd derivative matrix
    is the same as for option 2, since it is not possible to compute
    the 2nd derivative with only a 2-point stencil.

    10 - The domain [xMin, xMax] is assumed to be periodic. A 5-point stencil
    is used everywhere. A grid point will be placed at xMin but not
    xMax.  This option is like scheme=0 but more accurate.

    11 - Same as scheme=10, except a grid point will be placed at xMax but
    not xMin.  This option is like scheme=1 but more accurate.

    12 - The domain [xMin, xMax] is assumed to be non-periodic. A 5-point
    stencil is used everywhere.  The first two and last two rows of
    the differentiation matrices will then each have non-pentadiagonal
    elements.

    13 - The same as option 12, except that 3-point stencils are used for the
    first and last rows of the differentiation matrices, and 4-point
    stencils are used for the 2nd and penultimate rows of the
    differentiation matrices.  With this option, both differentiation
    matrices are strictly penta-diagonal.

    20 - The domain [xMin, xMax] is assumed to be periodic. Spectral
    differentiation matrices are returned. A grid point will be placed
    at xMin but not xMax.

    21 - Same as scheme=20, except a grid point will be placed at xMax but not
    xMin.

Outputs:

    x - column vector with the grid points.

    w - column vector with the weights for integration using the trapezoid rule.

    D - matrix for differentiation.

    DD - matrix for the 2nd derivative.

There is a prefactor that depends on Z which is only known numerically
(table on p.74 in Helander & Sigmar and Table III in Spitzer & HÃ¤rm).
Let's interpolate to find the value for any Z. Since there is a data
point at infinity, lets use 1/Z for the interpolation.
Simplified expression in Chang (Eq. [5-76]):
sigma = 19.2307e3*T.^(1.5)./Z./lnLambda;
