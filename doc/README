Here the CODE documentation is contained.
Go to Sphinx and type "make html" in prompt.
This will create a folder build in which the folder html is created.
In the html folder there will be index.html which you can open with firefox.
This will contain the documentation.

In Sphinx/source the source code for the Sphinx documentation exists

Also the OLD code documentation is contained in OLDCODEUserGuide.pdf
What is mostly changed is in implemenations.
All relevant physics are the same, but code is not.
