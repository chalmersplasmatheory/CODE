Testfunctions for comparing CODE and new CODE

ComparisionTestScript selects random variables to use for the test, then runs CODE
and new CODE with these values. Output files with Test_date_iteration.mat if both runs where
succesfull, ErrorCODE_date_iteration.mat if one of the two crashed and Double_ErrorCODE_date_iteration.mat
if both crashed. 

e is error caused by CODE and e2 is error caused by new CODE.
resCODE is result struct from CODE and resCODENew is result object from new CODE.

ManyTests is basically just a for loop for ComparisionTestScript. TestScript is a file
which is segmented to either check for errors or check if results are the same.
