In this folder, you will find things relevant to take up the project of rewriting CODE to object oriented.
All vital parts are implemented and the CODE runs. 

What is left to do is to implement some grid modes for momementum (if necessary)
and maybe more importantly, implement other time advance schemes than Eueler backwards.
It is also left to implement xi dependent runaway regions (only change integration when
runaways are calculated). The functions used are implemented in the help functions but 
they are not used.

To implement other time advance schemes, a new solver should maybe be written.

More importantly, it is left to benchmark the CODE against both old CODE and actual data
    The work to benchmark against old CODE has started and results and test scripts can be 
    found in this folder under TestFunctions.

Somethings are not implemented, and almost all things that are not implemented can be found in 
the folder FilesForDev.
    CODE_timeDependent2.m - 
        contains mostly unimplemented things, 
        but also some things that are implemented (at the end when the file from which I took all
        functionionality from reduced in size, I got worse at deleting parts which I implemented).
        It is from this File I worked and extracted different parts into modules

    GridExtension.m -
        Contains the parts from the grid extension algorithm.

    PlotandOther.m -
        90% is plot scripts or help functions for the plotting
        The other 10% is things I considered unecessary for new
        CODE, as the check on the output struct and comparison to
        the input struct when doing a restart
    

Documenation of the code exists in "head folder"/doc in the form of Sphinx documenation.
In the doc folder there exists a README file which describes how to access the documenation.
