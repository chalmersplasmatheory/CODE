In this folder, all files I used to yank code from old code lies.
This means that it is the things not copied to new CODE exists here 
(although not always true as I got worse at the end to remove things I
copied over). What it is not true for are some helperfunctions and the
ChiuHarvey source things. The ChiuHarveySource should be looked over
some more time as this was hard to understand what it did in the original
CODE due to massive spread in where it did things.

More specifically the files contain:
    CODE_timeDependent2.m - 
        contains mostly unimplemented things, 
        but also some things that are implemented (at the end when the file from which I took all
        functionionality from reduced in size, I got worse at deleting parts which I implemented).
        It is from this File I worked and extracted different parts into modules of new CODE.

    GridExtension.m -
        Contains the parts from the grid extension algorithm.

    PlotandOther.m -
        90% is plot scripts or help functions for the plotting
        The other 10% is things I considered unecessary for new
        CODE, as the check on the output struct and comparison to
        the input struct when doing a restart
